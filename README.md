# Rspec_fizzbuzz

The aim of the lab was to write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. For multiples of three the program should print “Fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples of five to print “Buzz”. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print to “FizzBuzz”. 

The programming language used to run test the code was Ruby on rails.
